# Symmetric difference between two arrays (or more)
The mathematical term symmetric difference (△ or ⊕) of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the two sets but not in both. For example, for sets A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4}, A △ B = {1, 4}.
Symmetric difference is a binary operation, which means it operates on only two elements. So to evaluate an expression involving symmetric differences among three elements (A △ B △ C), you must complete one operation at a time. Thus, for sets A and B above, and C = {2, 3}, A △ B △ C = (A △ B) △ C = {1, 4} △ {2, 3} = {1, 2, 3, 4}.

Create a function that takes two or more arrays and returns an array of their symmetric difference. The returned array must contain only unique values (no duplicates).

# Inventory Update
Compare and update the inventory stored in a 2D array against a second 2D array of a fresh delivery. Update the current existing inventory item quantities (in arr1). If an item cannot be found, add the new item and quantity into the inventory array. The returned inventory array should be in alphabetical order by item.
